CAMPUS MAP IMAGE PLACEMENT

Please place the campus map image file here with the filename:
  campus-map.jpg

The image should be:
- A satellite/aerial view of AMBO University Weliso Campus
- Optimized for web (compressed JPEG format)
- High enough resolution to clearly show buildings and landmarks

The image will be used as the base layer for the static campus map system.
Location pins will be overlaid on this image using pixel coordinates defined in:
  client/src/data/campusLocations.js
